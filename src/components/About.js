        I was born on march 4th, 1993 in Chivilcoy, Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have grown up with technology because my father is a hardware technician with a experience greater than 40 years, I worked with him by 7 years 
        where I got my first experiences in hardware and software, and while I was studying as well... until I graduated. So, today I am a semi senior web full stack developer, specializing in backend development. Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic web projects. Well-versed in numerous programming languages including native PHP OPP, Javascript/Jquery, MySQL, Frameworks like Laravel, Bootstrap, ReactJS, Template engines like Smarty, Symfony and complementary tools like Git, Jira, Docker, Figma, AWS and Prestashop (CMS).
